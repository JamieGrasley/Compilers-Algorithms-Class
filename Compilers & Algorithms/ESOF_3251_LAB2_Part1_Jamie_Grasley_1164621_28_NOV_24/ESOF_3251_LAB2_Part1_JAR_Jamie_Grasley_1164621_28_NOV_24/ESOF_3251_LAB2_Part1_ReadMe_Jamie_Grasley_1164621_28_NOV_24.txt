Running the JARs
-----------------
To run any of the jar files you must first open a terminal in that directory (or open a terminal and cd into the folder with the two jars). In this case the directory is this one.

To run the SortAnalyzer use
java -jar SortAnalyzer.jar

To run the TestDriver use
java -jar TestDriver.jar
